      <h1>The next ice age</h1>
      <h2>might start in another <span class="years-to-ice-age">50.000</span> years</h2>
      <p>It's not easy to predict when the next <i>ice age</i> will begin, but it's estimated to occur in approximately <span class="years-to-ice-age">50.000</span> years. When I refer to an <i>ice age</i> I mean a <i>glacial period</i>, a time when substantial portions of Earth are covered in ice. Currently we are technically in an <i>ice age</i>, specifically in an <i>interglacial period</i>. However, the term <i>ice age</i> can have varying interpretations depending on who you ask.</p>
      <p>Anyway in the next <i>ice age</i>, I envision Earth resembling the icy landscapes of <i>Star Wars' Hoth</i>. I think I might prefer the warmer conditions of a <i>Greenhouse Earth</i>.</p>
      <p>If we take <span class="years-to-ice-age">50.000</span> years as a given and assume an average human lifespan of <span class="years-life-expectancy">80</span> years, the next <i>ice age</i> is projected to occur in approximately <span class="lifetimes-to-ice-age">625</span> lifetimes.</p>
