      <p>It appears that the necessity for a "quetta" stems from the need to describe data volumes. It doesn't seem to be inherently related to time, but rather, it serves as a unit of measurement that can also be applied to other quantities.</p>
      <p>The introduction of "quetta" into the metric system took place in 2022, concurrently with the inclusion of other units like "ronna," "ronto," and "quecto."</p>
      <p>The primary reason for introducing new measurement units is to 'allow clear and unambiguous communication of measurements for many years to come' (R. Brown).</p>
